                        Submission reviews are often completed in about 24 hours, something that PeerMe strives for! Due to the high volume of submissions and the time it may take your submission reviewer to give personalized feedback, the turnaround period for submission evaluations
                        may be up to one week.

                        If the option is available you can now cancel a submission after it has been made. Once a submission has been picked up to review you will not have the option to cancel it. If you would like to cancel your submission for a project you will first want
                        to navigate to the project page. Once there you will see a link to Cancel Submission in the upper right hand corner of the page.

                        For each submission you make, we provide you with a rubric which will be used to grade it. Once you've made a submission, we will provide you with a random submission from one of your peers taking the same course and you will check it against the rubric.
                        Afterwards, you will submit your review and any feedback you may have through our site. Your submission will be given a Meets Specifications grade if you've successfully completed the rubric requirements. If the reviewer determines
                        that one or more items were not met, you will receive a Requires Changes grade. You'll need to make the necessary corrections, then submit again. You will only get one chance to re-submit. Once all submissions from a given course
                        are reviewed, awards and achievements will be distributed accordingly. Users may check their standing on the Leaderboard page. All reviews will be anonymous. Honesty, quality and a path to improvement is what PeerMe's founders
                        envisioned for their users.

                        If your submission requires changes, then fret not. Your reviewer will submit a completed rubric and their feedback to help you. Take a close look at the feedback and comments they provide and make adjustments to your submission. Once you feel you’ve
                        made the required corrections, re-submit your project.

                        Yes, you will be allowed only one re-submission. In the interest of time and quality of work, we want users to do their best but in accordance to a pre-defined timeline. However, if users wish to re-do their submission more than once, then they can only
                        do so by signing up for the same course the next time it is offered or at a later date.

                        If you subscribe to one of our plans, then you’ll be charged monthly until you cancel your subscription, which you can do any time. You will still have paid access to your courses until the end of the billing period. Courses you were subscribed to will
                        disappear from your My Courses page. The subscription charges will stop after the billing period and there will be no payments in the future. There are no partial refunds, so any payments you made before canceling will not be refunded.
                        You will keep any Certificates you earned while subscribed. Work you did in unfinished courses will be saved and reappear if you subscribe again and re-enroll in that course.
